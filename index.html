    <!-- Back story -->
    <p class="top-text">
      Stay focused. In life you have to take the trash out, if you have trash in
      your life, take it out, throw it away, get rid of it, major key. You see
      the hedges, how I got it shaped up? It's important to shape up your
      hedges, it's like getting a haircut, stay fresh. They key is to have every
      key, the key to open every door. Bless up. Lion! Fan luv. In life you have
      to take the trash out, if you have trash in your life, take it out, throw
      it away, get rid of it, major key. Celebrate success right, the only way,
      apple.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another one. Let me be clear, you have to make it through the jungle to
      make it to paradise, that's the key, Lion! In life there will be road
      blocks but we will over come it. They never said winning was easy. Some
      people can't handle success, I can. The key to success is to keep your
      head above the water, never give up. The other day the grass was brown,
      now it's green because I ain't give up. Never surrender. Surround yourself
      with angels. Put it this way, it took me twenty five years to get these
      plants, twenty five years of blood sweat and tears, and I'm never giving
      up, I'm just getting started.
